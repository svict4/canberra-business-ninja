## Introduction

Scaling your SMB (Small and Medium-sized Businesses) is hard work. It's difficult to ascertain if a particular business district or the local corner shops is the best place to move to or best place to set up a new store. Understanding your customer needs is one thing, understanding your business needs is another. Or is it?

## Acknowledgments/Copyleft

In the "Spirit of Govhack" and being a 1337 h4x0r, this project was lovingly ripped off/forked from the Govhack project: `Where Should I Live`.

'Where Should I Live' was developed at the 2017 Australian GovHack at the ACT event. Visit their official [hackerspace](https://2017.hackerspace.govhack.org/project/where-should-i-live) for further information and the datasets used.

We congratulate them for winning a Govhack award in 2017 ðŸŽ‰ There is no greater honor than imitation ðŸ˜‰
