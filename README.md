## Introduction

Scaling your SMB (Small and Medium-sized Businesses) is hard work. It's difficult to ascertain if a particular business district or the local corner shops is the best place to move to or best place to set up a new store. Understanding your customer needs is one thing, understanding your business needs is another. Or is it?

### Better Enable Councils to Develop Local Economies

CanberraBusiness.Ninja offers local councils and governments the ability to analyse the demographics, geography, infrastructure and other economic data of areas within their jurisdiction by comparing the nature of businesses that already exist within their area of interest to similar businesses that sustainably operate in suburbs with a similar nature.

In doing this, segments of the economy, industries, or specific businesses that are lacking within a local council's area of interst are immediately flagged.
For example, if a suburb of interest contains 2 bakeries per 1000 people, but a similar suburb sustains 5 bakeries per 1000 people, then the fact that the density of bakeries within the area of interest is flagged. This allows governments to understand the deficiencies within their local economy from which they can plan zoning, infrastructure, and education/training to develop their local economy and create employment.

However, just because a government knowns which businesses are under-represented with an area, it is very difficult for them to dictate to entrepreneurs what businesses they should open and where those businesses should be located.

CanberraBusiness.Ninja addresses this problem by recommending to entrepreneurs and small business owners which places are optimal to locate their businesses; the under-represented businesses within a council area are the same areas that we recommend entrepreneurs to open businesses.

The way that our web application recommends locations to entrepreneurs is based on demographic and economic data to find where their business achieves the best market fit and least competition based on their data input into our application. The data a small business owner inputs relates to the nature of their target customers from which our application analyses the demographics of towns and suburbs to find the best fit.

'Where Should I Live' was developed at the 2017 Australian GovHack at the ACT event. Visit their official [hackerspace](https://2017.hackerspace.govhack.org/project/where-should-i-live) for further information and the datasets used.

We congratulate them for winning a Govhack award in 2017 ðŸŽ‰ There is no greater honor than imitation ðŸ˜‰
